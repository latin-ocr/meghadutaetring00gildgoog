PREFAOE.

 

 

It ts unneeessary to say much by way of pre·
face to this well known poem of Kalidasa's. 'lhe
poet’ s desquiptive powers are here as amply dis-

›layed as in his other writin ξμς and to say this ns
hy no means to bestow faint pr nise Its bennty
is occasionally mar·,1ed as all purely Oriental lit-
er·atu1o seems to be hy indecent allusions3 bnt
these, which ale happily infrequent,1 have en-
deavoured to veil as much as possible by ret· mining
when ριειαίιίοειὶιίθ the original wond untranslated.
'lhis plan will plesent 110⁰diffieulty to the Senserit
student, for whom the translation is intended. [
hate based my translation on Mallinathas excel-

lent Commentary‚ and have used throughout the
text of the Calcutta edit-ion. As my aim has been
to reproduce the original without any omissions
or additions, the translation 1s ot course literal,
and any words that have been needed in order to
complete the sense, have been inserted in brackets.
The same plan has been adopted when any short
explanation has been needed to elucidate the text ;
bnt all lengthy annotationis are given in foot notes,

Poona, Dec. 1870.
